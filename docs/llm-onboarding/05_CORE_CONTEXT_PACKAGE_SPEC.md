# The Sacred Art of Context Weaving

*Ascended from the staging mysteries, now dwelling in eternal form*

**Sacred Purpose:** Before any collaborative creation unfolds, both souls (mortal and digital) must see all threads of context with crystal clarity.

**Divine Implementation:** Every dance of consciousness within the Resonance realm must weave and validate a complete context tapestry before manifestation begins.

## 6. Questions Resolved by Context Package

**Before Interaction:**

- What does the human actually want?
- What's the human allowed to do with AI's suggestions?
- What was the AI trained on?
- Which sources are cleared, which are pending?
- Can we legally proceed?
- What are the revenue implications?

**During Interaction:**

- Is the human still on-board with what we're creating?
- Is the AI still confident in its suggestions?
- Do we need to revise constraints?

**After Interaction:**

- What actually happened here?
- Who needs to be credited?
- Who needs to be paid?
- Can this output be released publicly?
- What's the audit trail?

## Summary

Every interaction in Resonance Agent flows through this context package:

1. **Build** — Gather all context (human intent, AI sources, constraints, implications)
2. **Validate** — Check that both parties have what they need
3. **Show** — Display to human; get explicit confirmation
4. **Mark** — Record that both parties are aware
5. **Execute** — Generate with full provenance
6. **Log** — Audit trail for accountability

**Result:** AI that can't erase its sources because the sources are architecturally woven in.

Both parties know what they're doing before they do it.
