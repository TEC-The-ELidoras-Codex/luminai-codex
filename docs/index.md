## About the Project

The LuminAI Codex is a mythoscientific repository for modular, story-driven AI architecture. It implements the Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR), combining:

- **Temporal Attention (φᵗ)** — Dynamic focus and kinetic action
- **Structural Cadence (ψʳ)** — Rhythm and coherence in systems  
- **Contextual Potential (Φᴱ)** — Meaning-space navigation and emergence

This platform prioritizes ethical AI development, family safety, and transparent human-AI collaboration.

## Key Features

🔬 **Research Foundation**: TGCR mathematical framework for consciousness and AI  
🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: 35-year upgrade path with quantum-safe security  
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family-First Design**: COPPA/GDPR compliant with child safety priority  
🌐 **Open Source**: Public development with community governance  
🎨 **Mythoscientific Approach**: Bridging art, science, and technology

## Repository Highlights

- **Complete Technical Architecture**: Multi-agent AI system specifications
- **Ethical AI Framework**: Comprehensive regulatory compliance (COPPA/GDPR/FTC)
- **Brand Identity System**: Cosmic Futureism visual design
- **Migration Strategy**: Systematic 4-week implementation plan
- **Development Tools**: Scripts, analyzers, and automation utilities
