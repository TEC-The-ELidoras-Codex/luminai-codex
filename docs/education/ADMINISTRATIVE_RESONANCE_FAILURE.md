# Administrative Resonance Failure (ARF)

A field guide for documenting and reversing systemic school responses that punish distress and ignore antecedent harm.

## 1) Failure Chain Template

Use this checklist to record each link in the chain. Dates and artifacts matter.

- [ ] Precursor harm reported (bullying/exclusion/harassment)
  - Date(s):
  - Channel(s): email, portal, in-person, phone
  - Evidence: screenshots, emails, logs
- [ ] Administrative acknowledgment
  - Who acknowledged:
  - What actions promised:
  - Deadline given:
- [ ] Support plan status (IEP/504)
  - Existing supports:
  - Any removal/suspension of services (when/why):
- [ ] Escalation event
  - Behavior/language used under distress:
  - Context leading to event (ignored reports, isolation, etc.):
- [ ] Disciplinary action(s)
  - Type: suspension, isolation, no recess, lunch segregation, etc.
  - Duration:
- [ ] Restorative inquiry conducted?
  - Who asked why the language was used:
  - Instruction about harm provided:
- [ ] Post-incident supports restored/added?
  - Changes to IEP/504:
  - Counseling/mentoring supports:
- [ ] Narrative framing
  - How the student is described in records:
  - Evidence of antecedent harms in the file:

## 2) Evidence Pack

Keep a single folder with:

- Chronological log (dates, times, participants, outcomes)
- Copies of IEP/504 plans and any discontinuation notices
- Emails/letters to and from school officials
- Audio notes or contemporaneous summaries of meetings
- Screenshots from platforms where bullying occurred

## 3) Escalation Ladder (US)

1. Teacher/counselor follow-up (written)
2. Principal escalation (letter + request for minutes)
3. District Special Education Director / 504 Coordinator
4. State Dept. of Education complaint (IDEA procedural safeguards)
5. Office for Civil Rights (OCR) complaint — discrimination/denial of FAPE
6. State Protection & Advocacy (Disability Rights [State])
7. Education Law Center / local legal aid / state bar pro bono referral

Note: You can request an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) at public expense if you disagree with the school’s evaluation.

## 4) Interventions That Prevent Collapse

- Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) prior to punitive actions
- Crisis plan that pairs safety response with immediate support response
- Restorative circle addressing antecedent harm, not just visible outburst
- Trauma-informed instruction on why slurs and threats harm others
- Reintegration plan that repairs social standing and safety

---

## 5) Language Patterns (Use With Care)

Recommended phrasing for records:

- “This behavior communicates distress following unaddressed peer aggression”
- “Discipline without antecedent inquiry risks escalating alienation”
- “Requesting FBA and expedited IEP/504 meeting due to manifestation of disability”
- “Seeking dual-track response: safety + support within 24 hours”

Avoid:

- Labels that define identity (“violent kid”, “problem student”)
- Records without context (incident-only write-ups)

## 6) Ethics

Understanding causal failure never excuses harm. It mandates upstream prevention and humane response. Documentation is not about blame; it’s about building systems worthy of our children.
