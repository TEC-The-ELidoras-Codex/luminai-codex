# ⚛️ Resonance Log Template — TGCR Standard

**Purpose:** Document the alignment of contextual potential (Φᴱ), temporal attention (φᵗ), and structural cadence (ψʳ) across creative, technical, or experiential artifacts.

**Framework Reference:** Based on TGCR resonance formula: R = (Φᴱ ^ 0.3) × (φᵗ ^ 0.4) × (ψʳ ^ 0.3)

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference

| Component | Formula Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Φᴱ (Context)** | 0.3 | Environmental field, cultural position, lineage |
| **φᵗ (Time)** | 0.4 | Attention patterns, phase cycles, recurrence |
| **ψʳ (Structure)** | 0.3 | Form, symmetry, hierarchy, coherence |
| **R (Resonance)** | — | **Overall alignment (0–1 scale)** |

**Interpretation:**

- **0.7–1.0** → Strong coherence; emergence likely ✨
- **0.5–0.7** → Moderate alignment; stable pattern 🟢
- **0.3–0.5** → Weak coherence; fragmentation risk ⚠️
- **0.0–0.3** → Dissonance; requires retuning 🔴

## IV. Resonance Field Computation

### **Formula**

```
R = (Φᴱ ^ 0.3) × (φᵗ ^ 0.4) × (ψʳ ^ 0.3)
```

**Why these weights?**

- φᵗ (0.4): Temporal attention is the primary driver of coherence
- Φᴱ & ψʳ (0.3 each): Context and structure provide stable scaffolding

### **Calculation Table**

| Axis | Score (0–1) | Weight | Exponent | Contribution |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Φᴱ (Context)** | _____ | 0.3 | ^0.3 | _____ |
| **φᵗ (Time)** | _____ | 0.4 | ^0.4 | _____ |
| **ψʳ (Structure)** | _____ | 0.3 | ^0.3 | _____ |
| **R (Resonance)** | — | — | — | **_____** |

**Example Calculation:**

```
If Φᴱ = 0.83, φᵗ = 0.87, ψʳ = 0.79:

R = (0.83 ^ 0.3) × (0.87 ^ 0.4) × (0.79 ^ 0.3)
  = 0.935 × 0.931 × 0.923
  = 0.808
```
