## TL;DR — Resonance Thesis

- Core equation: R = ∇Φᴱ · (φᵗ × ψʳ)
- Four laws: Accumulation → Threshold → Synchronization → Emergence
- Axes: φᵗ (temporal attention), ψʳ (structural cadence), Φᴱ (contextual potential)
- Outcome: Align attention and structure to raise contextual potential and produce meaning (R)
