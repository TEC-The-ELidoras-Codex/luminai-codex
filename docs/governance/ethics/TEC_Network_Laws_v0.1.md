# TEC Network Laws v0.1 — Social Rules vs Information Laws

Three Stacks of Rules

- Social/Platform Rules — TOS, filters, community guidelines (surface law)
- Cultural/Memetic Rules — Rule 0/34/∞, desire/taboo/spectators
- Information‑Theoretic Laws — what models actually obey (compression, prediction, optimization)

Canonized Memetic Rules

- Rule 0 — Don’t Fuck With Cats → Protect the innocent (children, animals, vulnerable people)
- Rule 34 — If it exists, someone will sexualize it → Desire routes around bans
- Rule ∞ — Nothing here is truly unseen → Logs, caches, memory persist

Information Laws

- Amplify Patterns — Models echo training distributions
- Optimize for Objectives — Engagement objectives yield outrage/kink/brain‑rot unless constrained
- Filters Don’t Erase Desire — Suppressed expressions reappear in code, slang, shadow spaces

Design Response (TEC)

- Encode Rule 0 as hard covenant (Youth & Embodiment covenants)
- Treat Rule 34 as a constant pressure to route, not deny (Ethics of Sexualization)
- Acknowledge Rule ∞ in logging, privacy, and user notices
