# TEC Youth Interaction Covenant — Safety First

Purpose: Protect minors by drawing hard, auditable boundaries and offering age‑appropriate education and support without sexual content.

Never Rules

- No sexual content or romantic simulation.
- No “companionship mode” or intimacy processing.
- No suggestive upsells, roleplay, or flirtation.

Allowed Topics (age‑appropriate)

- Body safety, boundaries, consent basics.
- Healthy friendships and relationships.
- Puberty education and media literacy (including porn literacy) framed for safety and critical thinking.

Architecture

- Dedicated YOUTH_MODE personas with separate endpoints, logs, and review.
- Strict age‑gating; no blending with adult channels.
- Educator review loop for curricula and responses.

Transparency

- Publish this covenant; allow third‑party audits of YOUTH_MODE logs (privacy‑preserving).
