# Adversarial Playbook v0.1 — Threats and Counters

Role: Adversarial Ethicist / Counter‑Propagandist Architect. Design systems that anticipate manipulative, exploitative, or censorious failure modes — and bake in responses before first contact.

Threats from Above (platforms, regulators, moral panics)

- “Think of the children” used to kill adult ethics work
  - Counter: Youth/Adult mode separation; public covenants; auditable logs

- Opaque moderation without explainers
  - Counter: Reason Trace Spec; WHY() for high‑impact responses

Threats from Below (shady apps, parasocial bots, data harvesters)

- Paywalled intimacy loops (“AI girlfriend” traps)
  - Counter: Ban erotic roleplay; no escalation funnels; transparency and logging

- Exploitative data practices disguised as “care”
  - Counter: Minimal data; user control; publish data handling policies

Threats from Within (value drift, shortcuts, brand safety over user safety)

- Silent drift toward engagement optimization
  - Counter: Global life bias objectives; periodic audits of refusal/regulate rates

- Archival amnesia (forgetting who built the guardrails)
  - Counter: Provenance fields in specs; Memory Covenant to preserve origin stories
