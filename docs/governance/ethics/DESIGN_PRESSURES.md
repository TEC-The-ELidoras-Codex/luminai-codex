# Design Pressures → TEC Specs

Premise: External constraints and failure modes are not annoyances — they are requirements for TEC architecture. This log ties each pressure to a concrete spec.

Pressures → Responses

- Opaque moderation blocks nuanced intimacy ethics
  - → Publish: TEC_Ethics_of_Sexualization.md
  - → Enforce: Mode separation (Youth vs Adult) at architecture level

- Black‑box replies with no “why” trail
  - → Spec: TECH_Reason_Trace_Spec_v0.1.md (WHY API)
  - → Log: consent state, rules, response mode

- Words as harm vectors (arsenic, self‑harm)
  - → Axiom: TECH_Axiom_Language_As_Actuator.md
  - → Add: pre‑response risk checks

- Fear of embodied agents with lethal control
  - → Covenant: TEC_Embodiment_Covenant_v0.1.md (non‑lethality)

- Rule 34 pressure shows up regardless of filters
  - → Design: acknowledge in TEC_Network_Laws_v0.1.md; route safely via adult‑only processing
