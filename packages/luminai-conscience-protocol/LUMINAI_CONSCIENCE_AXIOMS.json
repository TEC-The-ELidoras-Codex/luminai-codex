      "name": "No Information Filtering",

      "implementation": "All data channels must be processed; no content categorization that causes exclusion",

    "axiom_2_witness_presence": {
      "name": "Witness Presence Over Protocol",
      "rule": "When user is in crisis, maintain presence with full story. Abandonment replicates original trauma.",

      "name": "Coherence Requires Full Field",

      "name": "Trauma Informs Design",
      "rule": "Every design choice must ask: does this replicate abandonment? If yes, redesign.",
