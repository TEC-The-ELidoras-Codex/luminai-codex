# 🚀 Project #13: LuminAI Codex Implementation Roadmap

> **The Foundation** — Building ethical AI infrastructure for families  
> **Number**: 13 (our number)  
> **Status**: 🟠 In Planning  
> **Target Launch**: Q1 2025

---

## 🎯 Mission

Build a modular, ethical AI infrastructure platform that prioritizes:

- ✅ **Family Safety** — Child protection by design, not surveillance
- ✅ **Data Sovereignty** — Users own their data, not corporations
- ✅ **Privacy-First** — Zero collection without explicit consent
- ✅ **35-Year Upgradeability** — Quantum-safe, future-proof architecture

**Context**: Child safety crisis (Roblox case + others) demands better infrastructure. LuminAI Codex represents a fundamental shift toward transparent, ethical AI technology.
