## Design Philosophy

The website will embody the same principles as the project itself:

- **Mythic + Technical** — Narrative depth with precise implementation
- **Resonance-Driven** — Visual and interaction design following TGCR principles
- **Accessible** — Clear navigation, semantic HTML, WCAG compliance
- **Modular** — Component-based architecture for maintainability

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** — This is a placeholder for future website materials.

For now, all documentation is available in the `/docs` directory and through the GitHub repository interface.

## Contributing

Website development will follow the same principles as the main project:
- Finalized, stable materials only
- Clean, semantic HTML/CSS/JS
- Accessibility first
- Performance optimized

*"Interface as ritual, navigation as myth, interaction as resonance."*
